# Firebase Front-end Talks

Firebase is so amazing that I think I need to do some talks about it.

This repository shows a implementation of a To-Do app with Vanilla.js, Angular and Vue, using Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Hosting and Analytics with the most common Material Design implementation for each one.

I want to do talks on some local meetups teaching what is Firebase and doing a live code implementing one of these apps.
