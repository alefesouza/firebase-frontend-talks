# Firebase Front-end Talks

Firebase is so amazing that I think I need to do some talks about it.

This repository shows a implementation of a To-Do app with Vanilla.js, Angular and Vue, using Firebase Authentication, Firestore and Storage with the most common Material Design implementation for each one.

I want to do talks on some meetups teaching what is Firebase and doing a live code implementing one of these apps.

The .bolt file on this directory are the Firebase security rules for the named service.
