# firebase-vanilla

This is a project just for example purposes using Vanilla.js, do not expect something like use of build systems, use of HTML, CSS and JS in multiple files, advanced validations, etc, I will use native alerts and modern JavaScript in HTML files, remember that the main focus here is to teach the use of Firebase.
